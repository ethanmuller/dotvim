vim-dotfiles
============

Vim dotfiles. Yes, they deserve their own repo.

## Installation

Do you trust my ruby skills? If so, run `ruby install.rb`. This will put files into place, and back up any existing files that are in the way.

"Put files into place" means symlink the vimrc file and this whole directory.
