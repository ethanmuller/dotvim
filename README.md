vim-dotfiles
============

Vim dotfiles. Yes, they deserve their own repo. They're mostly here as a backup, but you're welcome to browse through and pick out pieces you like. Or you could go crazy and use them as-is.

## Installation

Want to go crazy and use them as-is? Do you trust my ruby skills? If so, run this:

    ruby install.rb

This will put files into place, and back up any existing files that are in the way. "Put files into place" means "symlink the vimrc file and this whole directory."
